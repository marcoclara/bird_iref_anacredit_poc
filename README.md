## Proof of Concept for BIRD-IReF Integration: Automating Regulatory Reporting via Harmonised Data Models

The purpose of this proof of concept is to demonstrate how the BIRD & IReF integration framework can be easily and successfully utilized by any bank to leverage the BIRD data model and automatically prepare and submit IReF-compliant reports, reducing manual effort, improving data quality, and ensuring regulatory alignment.

BIRD (Banks’ Integrated Reporting Dictionary) provides a standardised data model for banks to map internal data to regulatory requirements, and IReF (Integrated Reporting Framework) is the ECB’s initiative to unify statistical, supervisory, and resolution reporting into a single framework.

This proof of concept will simulate the process by which a bank can utilise BIRD to automatically generate IReF reports from its internal systems.
